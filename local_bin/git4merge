# A script to facilitate branch merging for collaborative development.
# In collaborative development, we would make a bunch of commits before
# merging them into the upstream branch by a squash.
#
# Here is an example:
#
# Remote branches:
#   upstream/master
#   upstream/dev-1.0
#
# Local branches:
#   origin/master
#   origin/dev-1.0
#
# When you attempt to merge origin/dev-1.0 into upstream/dev-1.0, run
#   git4merge dev-1.0
# under branch origin/dev-1.0. Then a new branch 4merge_dev-1.0 is ready
# to merge to the remote branch upstream/dev-1.0.
# Check CLI options
CUR_BRANCH=$(git branch | sed -n -e 's/^\* \(.*\)/\1/p')
SRC_BRANCH=$CUR_BRANCH
DST_BRANCH=upstream/$CUR_BRANCH
